        <h1>Refugees United: <br>SMS service</h1>

        <p>This is a prototype for a service to help people find missing families and friends by sending a simple SMS text message to <a href="http://refunite.org">Refugees United</a>.<p>

        <p>The demo was created by <a href="http://premasagar.com">Premasagar Rose</a> of <a href="http://dharmafly.com">Dharmafly</a>.</p>


        <h2>Demo 1: Getting help</h2>
        <p>Send the message "<strong>helpme</strong>" to <strong>07786 201114</strong> to receive instructions on how to report a person missing. The response will be:</p>

        <blockquote>
        	Send msg starting with "find" to 07786 201114. Give as much info as possible: "find Jomo Kibaki, tribe: Kikuyu, last seen: Nyeri, email: yourname@example.com"
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Demo 2: report a person</h2>
        <p>Follow those instructions, sending a message that starts with "<strong>find</strong>" to <strong>07786 201114</strong>. You'll receive the response:</p>

        <blockquote>
        	Thank you. We will get in touch if we have any news for you. Please tell your family and friends about Refugees United: 07786 201114.
        </blockquote>

       	<p>An admin for the service is sent an email notifying them of the reported person.</p>


        <h2>Notes</h2>

        <p>The prototype uses the SMS gateway service, <a href="http://taykt.com">Taykt</a>, which routes text messages to web applications. The web application can then process the message and respond. Taykt was chosen for its simplicity; other gateway services, e.g. <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> could be used, depending on requirements.</p>

        <p>For the first demo, messages starting "helpme" are passed to the application at the address <a href="http://refugee-sms.dharmafly.com/app/helpme">refugee-sms.dharmafly.com/app/helpme</a>. For the second demo, messages starting "find" are passed to the application at the address <a href="http://refugee-sms.dharmafly.com/app/find">refugee-sms.dharmafly.com/app/find</a>.

        <p>In this demo, refugee details are not logged in a database and no administrator control panel is provided.</p>

        <p>The phone number used here is UK-based. However, a phone number in any given country could be used, and the end user could be charged only for sending a message to a local number. Depending on the gateway service used, Refugee United would be charged a small fee.</p>
